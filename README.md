Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.
Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the Medallion Architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
Data Architecture

    Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

    Silver Layer: Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

    Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema designed for reporting and analytics.

Project Overview

This project involves:

    Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).

    ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

    Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

    Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.
Specifications

    Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

    Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.

    Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

    Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

    Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
Objective

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

    Customer Behavior

    Product Performance

    Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
